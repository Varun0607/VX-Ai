# VonAI - Generate 4K Images from Textual Inputs

VonAI is a full-stack web application that allows users to generate 4K images from textual inputs. Users can save these images on their personal wall and download them in JPG format. This project leverages the power of OpenAI's API for image generation.

  - ReactJS for building the user interface.
  - Tailwind CSS for styling the application.
  - Vite for fast development and building.

- **Backend**:
  - ExpressJS as the server framework.
  - Node.js for server-side JavaScript.
  - MongoDB as the database for storing user data and image metadata.

## Features

- Generate 4K images from textual inputs using OpenAI's API.
- Save generated images to a personal wall.
- Download generated images in JPG format.
- User authentication and registration.
- Store user-specific data in MongoDB.
